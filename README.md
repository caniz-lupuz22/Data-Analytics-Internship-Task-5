# Fuel Consumption Prediction (Structured Data)

This repository contains analysis and modeling workflow aimed at predicting fuel consumption (MPG) of vehicles using structured data features. It includes data exploration, feature engineering, regression model building, and evaluation.

## Contents

- `Fuel_Consumption_Prediction_Structured_Test.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code for loading data, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and validation.

## Key Tasks

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Feature selection and engineering
- Regression modeling for MPG prediction
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains vehicle features including:
- Cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight
- Acceleration, model year, origin
- Target variable: miles per gallon (MPG)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and prediction workflow.

## Internship Context

This project was completed during a data analytics internship, demonstrating skills in regression analysis, structured data handling, and predictive modeling using Python frameworks.
